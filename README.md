# MatlabAntlrGrammar

An ANTLR4 grammar for MATLAB

## Requirements

Developing a grammar using ANTLR requires [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Version 8 is recommended for this project. Make sure that `java` and `javac` are available on your system path.

## Note

Class support is not fully tested. Please open an issue if you face problems.

## Visual Studio Code Tasks

This repository comes with Visual Studio Code tasks (located in the `.vscode` folder). These tasks will help you test and develop the grammar. To run the tasks, select *Terminal -> Run Build Task...* from the application menu.

## Antlr Notes

* `*` matches zero or more repetitions
* `+` matches one or more repetitions
* `?` matches zero or one
